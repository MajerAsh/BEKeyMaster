/*
  WARNING: This file was moved to `db/local/schema.local.sql` and is kept here
  as a pointer only. The original `schema.sql` is destructive (drops tables)
  and MUST NOT be run against hosted or production databases (Supabase, etc.).

  For local development that requires a full reset, use:
    - `BEKeyMaster/db/local/schema.local.sql`

  For deployed databases, use the additive SQL migrations in `BEKeyMaster/db/`
  (files named `create_*.sql`, `badges.sql`, etc.) which avoid DROP TABLE.
